# SociaLIZE-18

## Description
This API was built for a social network web app where users can share their thoughts, add friends, and react to friends' thoughts. 
The application was built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, npm and the NO-SQL ODM Mongoose. 
    
## Technologies
    For this project, I consulted various YouTube channels to help get started on some of the logic within the starter code.
    I also used VS Code, JavaScript, Node.js, Insomnia, MongoDB Compass W3schools and JavaScript.info for documentation. I also use the VS code extensions,
    Blockman and Color Blocks to help me see the code better and organize my notes for deeper learning.
